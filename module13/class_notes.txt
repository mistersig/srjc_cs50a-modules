/* CSS Media Queries for typical devices */

/* 1: Extra small devices (phones, less than 768px) */
/* No media query since this is the default ruleset in a "mobile first" approach */

/* 2: Small devices (tablets, 768px and up) */
@media (min-width:768px) { 

}

/* 3: Medium devices (desktops, 992px and up) */
@media (min-width: 992px) { 

}

/* 4: Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media (min-width: 1200px) { 


}

    less than 768px
