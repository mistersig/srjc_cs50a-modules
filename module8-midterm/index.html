            <p>
                Cranes are a family, the Gruidae, of large, long-legged, and long-necked birds in the group Gruiformes.
                The
                15
                species of cranes are placed in three genera, Antigone, Balearica, and Grus. Unlike the similar-looking
                but
                unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks outstretched, not pulled back. Cranes live on all continents
                except
                Antarctica and South America.

                They are opportunistic feeders that change their diets according to the season and their own nutrient
                requirements. They eat a range of items from small rodents, eggs of birds, fish, amphibians, and insects
                to
                grain and berries.

                Cranes construct platform nests in shallow water, and typically lay two eggs at a time. Both parents
                help to
                rear the young, which remain with them until the next breeding season.

                Some species and populations of cranes migrate over long distances; others do not migrate at all. Cranes
                are
                solitary during the breeding season, occurring in pairs, but during the nonbreeding season, most species
                are
                gregarious, forming large flocks where their numbers are sufficient.

                Most species of cranes have been affected by human activities and are at the least classified as
                threatened,
                if
                not critically endangered. The plight of the whooping cranes of North America inspired some of the first
                US
                legislation to protect endangered species.

                The cranes' beauty and spectacular mating dances have made them highly symbolic birds in many cultures
                with
                records dating back to ancient times. Crane mythology is widely spread and can be found in areas such as
                India,
                the Aegean, South Arabia, China, Korea, Japan, and North America. In northern Hokkaidō, the women of the
                Ainu
                people performed a crane dance that was captured in 1908 in a photograph by Arnold Genthe. In Korea, a
                crane
                dance has been performed in the courtyard of the Tongdosa Temple since the Silla Dynasty (646 CE).
                <br>

                The Sanskrit epic poet Valmiki was inspired to write the first śloka couplet by the pathos of seeing a
                male
                sarus crane shot while dancing with its mate.
                <br>
                In Mecca, in pre-Islamic South Arabia, Allāt, Uzza, and Manāt were believed to be the three chief
                goddesses
                of
                Mecca, they were called the "three exalted cranes" (gharaniq, an obscure word on which 'crane' is the
                usual
                gloss). See The Satanic Verses for the best-known story regarding these three goddesses.

                In China, several styles of kung fu take inspiration from the movements of cranes in the wild, the most
                famous
                of these styles being Wing Chun, Hung Gar (tiger crane), and the Shaolin Five Animals style of fighting.
                Crane
                movements are well known for their fluidity and grace.
                <br>

                The Greek for crane is <em>Γερανος </em> <strong>(geranos)</strong>, which gives us the cranesbill, or
                hardy
                geranium. The crane was a bird
                of omen. In the tale of Ibycus and the cranes, a thief attacked Ibycus (a poet of the sixth century BCE)
                and
                left him for dead. Ibycus called to a flock of passing cranes, which followed the attacker to a theater
                and
                hovered over him until, stricken with guilt, he confessed to the crime.

                Pliny the Elder wrote that cranes would appoint one of their number to stand guard while they
                slept. The sentry would hold a stone in its claw, so that if it fell asleep, it would drop the stone and
                waken.
                A crane holding a stone in its claw is a well-known symbol in heraldry, and is known as a crane in its
                vigilance. Notably, however, the crest of Clan Cranstoun depicts a sleeping crane still in vigilance and
                holding
                the rock in its raised claw.

                Aristotle describes the migration of cranes in the History of Animals, adding an account of their fights
                with Pygmies as they wintered near the source of the Nile. He describes as untruthful an account that
                the
                crane
                carries a touchstone inside it that can be used to test for gold when vomited up. (This second story is
                not
                altogether implausible, as cranes might ingest appropriate gizzard stones in one locality and
                regurgitate
                them
                in a region where such stone is otherwise scarce.)

                Greek and Roman myths often portrayed the dance of cranes as a love of joy and a celebration of life,
                and
                the
                crane was often associated with both Apollo and Hephaestus.
                <br>
                In pre-modern Ottoman Empire, sultans would sometimes present a piece of crane feather [Turkish: turna
                teli]
                to
                soldiers of any group in the army<strong> (janissaries, sipahis etc.)</strong> who performed heroically
                during a
                battle. Soldiers
                would attach this feather to their caps or headgears which would give them some sort of a rank among
                their
                peers.
                <br>
                Throughout Asia, the crane is a symbol of happiness and eternal youth. In Japan, the crane is
                one of the mystical or holy creatures <strong>(others include the dragon and the tortoise)</strong> and
                symbolizes good fortune
                and longevity because of its fabled life span of a thousand years. The crane is one of the
                subjects in the tradition of origami, or paper folding. An ancient Japanese legend promises that anyone
                who
                folds a thousand origami cranes will be granted a wish by a crane. After World War II, the
                crane came to symbolize peace and the innocent victims of war through the story of schoolgirl Sadako
                Sasaki
                and
                her thousand origami cranes. Suffering from leukemia as a result of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and
                knowing
                she was dying, she undertook to make a thousand origami cranes before her death at the age of 12. After
                her
                death, she became internationally recognised as a symbol of the innocent victims of war and remains a
                heroine to
                many Japanese girls.
