            The cranes are diurnal birds that vary in their sociality by season and location. During the breeding
            season, they are territorial and usually remain on their territory all the time. In contrast in the
            non-breeding season, they tend to be gregarious, forming large flocks to roost, socialize, and in some
            species feed. Sarus Crane breeding pairs maintain territories throughout the year in south Asia, and
            non-breeding birds live in flocks that can also be seen throughout the year. Large aggregations of
            cranes likely increase safety for individual cranes when resting and flying and also increase chances for
            young unmated birds to meet partners.
