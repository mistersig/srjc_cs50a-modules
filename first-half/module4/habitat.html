            The cranes have a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring across most of the world continents. They are absent
            from
            Antarctica and, mysteriously, South America. East Asia has the highest crane diversity, with eight species,
            followed by Africa, which holds five resident species and wintering populations of a sixth. Australia,
            Europe,
            and North America have two regularly occurring species each. Of the four crane genera, Balearica (two
            species)
            is restricted to Africa, and Leucogeranus (one species) is restricted to Asia; the other two genera, Grus
            (including Anthropoides and Bugeranus) and Antigone, are both widespread.

            Many species of cranes are dependent on wetlands and grasslands, and most species nest in shallow wetlands.
            Some
            species nest in wetlands, but move their chicks up onto grasslands or uplands to feed (while returning to
            wetlands at night), whereas others remain in wetlands for the entirety of the breeding season. Even the
            demoiselle crane and blue crane, which may nest and feed in grasslands (or even arid grasslands or deserts),
            require wetlands for roosting at night. The Sarus Crane in south Asia is unique in having a significant
            breeding
            population using agricultural fields to breed in areas alongside very high density of humans and intensive
            farming, largely due to the positive attitudes of farmers towards the cranes. In Australia, the Brolga
            occurs in
            the breeding areas of Sarus Cranes in Queensland state, and they achieve sympatry by using different
            habitats.
            Sarus Cranes in Queensland largely live in Eucalyptus-dominated riverine, while most Brolgas use non-wooded
            regional ecosystems that include vast grassland habitats. The only two species that do not always roost in
            wetlands are the two African crowned cranes (Balearica), which are the only cranes to roost in trees.

        </p>

            Some crane species are sedentary, remaining in the same area throughout the year, while others are highly
            migratory, traveling thousands of kilometres each year from their breeding sites. A few species like Sarus
            Cranes have both migratory and sedentary populations, and healthy sedentary populations have a large
            proportion
            of cranes that are not territorial, breeding pairs.
