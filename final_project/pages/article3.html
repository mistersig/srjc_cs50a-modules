                        Investing does not need to be complicated. In fact, it can be very simple and highly rewarding.
                        If done right, you can potentially earn comparable returns to someone with sophisticated
                        techniques.

                        When it comes to your investing approach, the range of options on how to do it is broad. You can
                        use full-service financial advisors who will take care of everything for you. Or you can choose
                        a DIY model where you’re in charge of making the decisions freeing you from advisory fees.

                        One really great way to invest simply is through a 3 fund portfolio.

                        This is an investing approach made widely popular by the Bogleheads. A group of investing
                        enthusiasts inspired by Vanguard's founder John Bogle; a huge advocate for simplified, low-cost
                        investing.
                    </p>

                    <p>A three-fund portfolio is a portfolio which uses only basic asset classes — usually a domestic
                        stock "total market" index fund, an international stock "total market" index fund and a bond
                        "total market" index fund. It is often recommended for and by Bogleheads attracted by "the
                        majesty of simplicity" (Bogle's phrase), and for those who want finer control and better
                        tax-efficiency than they would get in an all-in-one fund like a target retirement fund.

                        There is no magic in the number three; the phrase is shorthand for a style of portfolio
                        construction that emphasizes simplicity, and is related to lazy portfolios.

                        A three-fund portfolio is based on the fundamental asset classes, stocks and bonds. It is
                        assumed that cash is not counted within the investment portfolio, so it is not included. On the
                        other hand, it is assumed that every investor should hold both domestic and international
                        stocks. The task, then, is to take these three basic non-cash assets — domestic stocks,
                        international stocks, and bonds — decide how much of each to hold (your asset allocation);
                        choose where to hold each of these asset classes, and finally choose a mutual fund to use for
                        each asset class.
