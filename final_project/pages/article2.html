                <div id="mainarticle">
                    <p>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of
                        higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?
                        Absolutely, I can't remember a time when I wasn't planning to get at least some sort of graduate
                        degree. My parents grew up middle to upper-middle class, both went to top-ranked schools, and
                        both have graduate degrees, so every discussion about my future followed a similar plan. I went
                        to an Ivy League university for my undergraduate degree and am now in graduate school. My
                        parents paid for college (no financial aid/scholarships), including housing, food, trips home,
                        and a monthly allowance. My PhD program pays $48,000 and my advisor pays for my tuition, but one
                        of my parents supplements that with additional financial support because they want me to focus
                        on school and not worry about money or housing-related concerns. I'm very lucky to have their
                        support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent/guardian(s)
                        educate you about finances?
                        My parents divorced when I was young, and my dad made significantly more than my mom, so it was
                        interesting in hindsight to see the different conversations that were had in each home. Money
                        was a common topic in both homes, but my mom was a teacher so those conversations tended to
                        focus more on the day-to-day aspects of personal finance and budgeting. For example, we'd go
                        grocery shopping with a set amount of cash, so I got used to checking prices and tallying in my
                        head as I shop. On the other hand, my dad worked on Wall Street, so those conversations tended
                        to focus more on understanding market trends and investments. I think I got a solid conceptual
                        education between the two, but I didn't have a ton of experience with actually handling and
                        budgeting my own money until grad school (and also had undiagnosed ADHD, I'm prone to impulse
                        spending), so I've definitely made some poor financial choices over the years (see my credit
                        card debt). But I'm extremely privileged to be in a position where most of those choices haven't
                        significantly impacted my financial future or current lifestyle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What was your first job and why did you get it?
                        My first job was probably an internship at a biomedical research company over the summer after
                        my sophomore year? It was definitely the first time I'd been paid for work, although I
                        volunteered at summer camps before that. I didn't work in high school and my parents gave me a
                        monthly allowance in college (in addition to being on an unlimited meal plan, which was the only
                        option for the dorm I lived in), so I had minimal expenses that needed to be covered. My first
                        job that I actually used to pay for living expenses was probably a combination of my PhD and
                        social media work, which I started around the same time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Did you worry about money growing up?
                        Yes and no. I was definitely aware of money because of the discrepancy between my parents'
                        incomes, but I wouldn't say I worried about money as it related to the stability of my life and
                        my hobbies. My parents did fight over money frequently though (at one point, they went to court
                        over how to split my tuition) so it was a stressful topic at times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do you worry about money now?
                        Again, yes and no. No, in that I have the privilege of having a financial safety net of
                        inherited income (and the support of my parents, if it ever came to that), so I'm not worried
                        about having enough money on a day-to-day basis. Yes, in that I'm much more aware of some bad
                        spending habits that I've developed and am actively working to develop better ones. I know that
                        I have a financial safety net and have used it more than I'd like. I want to use that money more
                        wisely so it continues to serve me in the future. I also definitely developed some emotional
                        spending habits during COVID that I initially didn't worry about because I figured it would be a
                        short-term thing, but it's turning out to be harder to break than I expected as we return to the
                        "new normal." I'm definitely susceptible to lifestyle inflation and impulse spending due to a
                        combination of ADHD and growing up either having or being able to buy pretty much anything I
                        needed, so I worry about whether I'll be able to really develop long-term habits or if I'll
                        always be susceptible to my neurodivergent brain.

                    <p>
                        At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial
                        safety net?
                        Well, I'm not financially independent right now, so I'll say hopefully by the time I finish my
                        PhD (age 27-28)? I'd say I became mostly financially responsible for myself at age 22 when I
                        started grad school since I had a job where I was getting paid enough to cover living expenses
                        (also a privilege, since PhD stipends are not known for being high), but I also have the
                        financial safety nets I mentioned earlier.
                        Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.
                        Yes, two inheritances — one account with about $35,000 in cash and another account currently
                        valued at around $100,000 in investments. I received the first account in 2019 and the second
                        when I turned 24. I make passive income from the dividends on both accounts.

                        Day One
                        6:30 a.m. — I wake up around 6:30 a.m. with the goal of working out on the spin bike I bought a
                        few months ago, although my success rate on that plan is currently around 20%. However, as of
                        yesterday, I'm fully vaccinated (14 days since my second Pfizer dose) so I decide to head over
                        to the gym for a 7:30 workout class. I just restarted my CrossFit gym membership, but I'm not
                        entirely sure I'm going to stick with it. I moved during the pandemic and it's kind of out of
                        the way now. There's another CrossFit gym closer to my apartment, but the reviews aren't great.
                        By the end of the class, I can definitely tell that I'm out of shape. I should have brought some
                        water but I jogged here without a bag, so I grab a water bottle on the way out and ask the
                        instructor to charge it to my account. $2
                        9:30 a.m. — Once I get home, I make a protein smoothie for breakfast and call my dad for our
                        weekly chat. I get a monthly Daily Harvest box of 24 smoothies, which is kind of expensive, but
                        I'm very lazy about making breakfast and if left to my own devices (and my ADHD
                        medication/antidepressants, which are both appetite suppressants) I would forget to eat anything
                        until the early afternoon, so I think it's worth the added cost. I do a quick Google search on
                        smoothie recipes before hopping into the shower — as much as I like Daily Harvest, I'm trying to
                        lower my monthly expenses and it takes up a ton of space in my freezer, so I'm looking for
                        similar recipes that I can make at home. I find a couple and save them to my reading list for
                        later.
                        12:30 p.m. — I spend the rest of the morning analyzing some old data from an experiment and
                        realize I'm missing a crucial part. I have a research proposal deadline in a few days that I
                        need this data for, so this is a bit of a setback. Tired of looking at this data, I take a break
                        from work to make lunch, which ends up being pasta with shrimp, parmesan, and vodka sauce.
                        4 p.m. — Two meetings and a COVID test (my school requires us to get tested weekly if we're
                        going to campus) later, and I'm starting to feel hungry. Well, not exactly. I'm not that hungry,
                        but I am starting to crave honey garlic boneless chicken bites from a restaurant in Allston.
                        I've spent a lot of money on DoorDash and UberEats in the last 14 months and I'm trying to cut
                        back these days, so I close out the UberEats tab I had open and try to distract myself for
                        another hour or two. I'm planning on making baked ziti for dinner tonight, but I order my
                        groceries using Amazon Fresh and they're not scheduled to be here until 5-7 p.m. And then I'll
                        need an hour to cook the ziti…. I really need to order some snacks with my next round of
                        groceries.
                        5 p.m. — I end up getting impatient and make some Annie's White Cheddar & Shells that I have in
                        the pantry. I'll make the baked ziti tomorrow. Then I head to bed early at around 8, as I'm
                        feeling pretty wiped and have a final exam in the morning.
                        Daily Total: $2

                        Day Two
                        6 a.m. — Wake up after getting ten wonderful hours of sleep and am feeling ready to start the
                        day! I make some coffee, listen to the latest episode of Pretty Basic, and end up purchasing the
                        4-Hour Work Week by Tim Ferris after Alisha Marie recommends it. I'm definitely susceptible to
                        influencer marketing, but unlike the random lifestyle products I see on Instagram, I feel like a
                        book will at least teach me something useful. Once I finish my coffee, I make my usual protein
                        smoothie for breakfast, get dressed, take my meds, and head over to my home office to get ready
                        for this 8:30 a.m. final exam. $12.99
                        10:20 a.m. — Submit my final exam and take a quick break before sitting back down to continue
                        working on the data analysis and writing from yesterday. I have a meeting with my committee at 2
                        to review this and the final document is due on Monday, so I'm a bit stressed. I'm also feeling
                        hungry, so I heat up the last of some beef stew that I made last week.
                        3:30 p.m. — Finish the call with my thesis committee, and as usual, I was stressed over nothing.
                        They were happy with my work and felt like I was solidly on track, so I feel better. Zoom
                        meetings always fry my brain though, and with the proposal stress and the final exam this
                        morning, I decide to start making dinner a bit early. Plus, I'd like to make this baked ziti
                        before I run out of energy. I use a recipe from NYT Cooking and listen to the latest episode of
                        My Brother, My Brother and Me, and then hop back onto my laptop to send some emails while I wait
                        for it to bake.
                        6 p.m. — Have some of the ziti for dinner and spend another few hours working on my research
                        proposal. Then I get ready for bed. I try to read before I go to bed, so I read on the Kindle
                        app on my iPad then fall asleep around 9:30.

                        Day Three
                        5:30 a.m. — I wake up and read for an hour before getting up. Then I make some coffee. I'm
                        debating on whether to walk over to Tatte for a breakfast treat and some fresh air, but I flip
                        through their website and they don't have anything that catches my eye. Maybe I'll head over to
                        Starbucks instead...
                        8:30 a.m. — I end up making my usual smoothie instead, fold some laundry, throw my comforter
                        into the washing machine, take out the trash and recycling, and start running the dishwasher.
                        This last week has been a little crazy because of this research proposal, so cleaning hasn't
                        been at the top of my priority list, but I've just taken my ADHD meds so my brain isn't quite
                        ready to get to work yet. Once things are slightly cleaner, I film a sponsor preview for a
                        YouTube video.
                        10:30 a.m. — I finish the preview, send it out, then write up an outline for a paper. I'm
                        feeling a bit hungry, so I make some waffles and eat that while I pay the next installment on my
                        West Elm Affirm loan since I got paid today (in monthly expenses). I bought a new bed frame and
                        a chair about two months ago, and the chair came immediately but the bed frame won't be here for
                        another month.

                        11:45 a.m. — I end up having to deal with some emails and administrative work before I can get
                        back to data labeling. I also order two new towels from Brooklinen as my current towels are
                        verging on threadbare and still have my name written on the tag from summer camp. I use a $20
                        off coupon that I got last week, bringing my order to a total of $63. With that done, I make a
                        note to check on a Glossier order that I put in two weeks ago and never got shipping
                        confirmation for, and get back to that data analysis. $63

                        3 p.m. — Mentally hit a wall about an hour ago and have been looking at couches ever since. I've
                        been wanting to get a new couch since I moved into my current apartment, but everything is
                        back-ordered due to COVID and I'd want to test out some options in-store to make sure they're
                        actually comfortable. Currently debating on whether to read a book or try to get back to work
                        since it seems like my brain has checked out for the day, but there are still a few things I'd
                        like to get done. I'll be working through the weekend regardless though — one of the perks of
                        monetizing your hobbies is that you rarely have a full day off. In the meantime, I eat two
                        protein bars and check on the delivery status of some wine that I ordered last week.

                        9:30 p.m. — I end up finishing one book and starting another, then have some baked ziti for
                        dinner and head to bed around 10. As usual, work stress keeps my brain running in circles for
                        another hour or so — my Oura Ring says that I actually fell asleep around 11:30.

                        Day Four
                        7:45 a.m. — I wake up and drag myself out of bed even though I'm tired because it's Saturday and
                        I always call my dad at 8 a.m. It's been a few days since I've really gotten outside and it's
                        supposed to be really warm out, so I put on a sundress with a light jacket, put in my
                        headphones, and order a Venti Salted Caramel Foam Cold Brew and Iced Lemon Pound Cake from
                        Starbucks. Then I call my dad and head out for a walk and some coffee. $10
                        11:30 a.m. — I get back after a five-mile walk feeling tired but good, make a list of the stuff
                        I need to get done this weekend, and change back into pajamas for a nap. Then I take a look
                        through the fridge and my cabinets to see what I have already so I can meal plan for the week. I
                        decide to make some pulled pork since it's easy to make in large quantities and I already know
                        it's going to be a busy week. Neither Amazon Fresh nor Whole Foods delivery has boneless pork
                        shoulder though, so I end up ordering from Wegmans on Instacart. $66
                        2:30 p.m. — Apparently this is the week that I replace all of my threadbare items. After
                        groceries, I start looking for new knee sleeves. I've had my old ones for four years and they're
                        literally falling apart at the seams, so I'm definitely due for a new pair. I find some that I
                        like at Strong Strong Supply, and add a weightlifting belt to my cart while I'm at it. Next on
                        the list is looking over some of the data analysis results from earlier this week, then making
                        two TikToks. I realize that I forgot to take my meds and crack open a bottle of Usual Rose to
                        sip while I work. $103
                        5 p.m. — A few hours of work and some YouTube videos from my Watch Later queue later and it's
                        time for some dinner. I'm still loving this baked ziti, so I reheat some of that for dinner. I
                        scroll through Instagram while I eat and end up falling prey to another IG ad, this time for
                        that foundation that supposedly perfectly matches your skin. They only charge you for it if you
                        keep it for more than 14 days though, so I'm planning to try it once for the fun of it and
                        return it immediately. I also head downstairs to pick up some packages. I got a Lululemon gift
                        card a while back and bought the Align Tank that everyone raves about and that Glossier order
                        finally came in. $5
                        9 p.m. — After another couple hours of work, I wash my face, put on a pimple patch for a rather
                        persistent whitehead, brush my teeth, and head to bed. I end up tossing and turning for a few
                        hours because I'm too hot, but the AC vent is right over my bed so if I turn it on, it will
                        immediately be too cold. Eventually, I fall asleep.

                        Day Five
                        6 a.m. — I wake up early and text one of my friends asking whether we can postpone our lunch to
                        next weekend. I didn't sleep well and am stressed about this research proposal deadline
                        tomorrow, so I'd rather just work through today and tomorrow and regroup later in the week. I
                        make some coffee and flip through new Compass listings near me. I'd eventually like to use that
                        larger inheritance as a down payment but it's unlikely that I'll buy in the area — the housing
                        prices around here are insane and I'm not planning to stay after grad school.
                        7 a.m. — I've finished my coffee, so it's time to take my meds. I have ADHD and depression, both
                        controlled by medication, and also take a biotin and collagen supplement because I find that my
                        skin breaks out a ton otherwise. I'm not sure if it's just a placebo, but I have a dermatologist
                        appointment next week, so I'm planning to bring it up and see what the doctor thinks. I'm a bit
                        nervous because this dermatologist is a white woman and I'm not sure if she has experience with
                        Black women's skin.
                        9:30 a.m. — I'm feeling more awake from the coffee but my ADHD meds haven't quite kicked in yet,
                        so I debate on making a cheese omelet for breakfast. I would make a smoothie, but my blender is
                        really loud and I try not to use it before 9 a.m. on the weekends because there's no way my
                        neighbors can't hear it, even if they're nice enough to not complain. I'm not that hungry
                        though, so I make some ginger tea instead. I end up making the omelet around 10, after watching
                        some YouTube videos.
                        10:30 a.m. — I have a call with an internet friend at 11 and would like to wrap up this research
                        proposal today, but we'll see what happens. I also need to make another two TikToks (I'm in a
                        paid program where I have to hit a quota each week), draft a script for this week's YouTube
                        video, and work on a fiction project for a writing class that I'm taking. PSA: don't monetize
                        all your hobbies, it makes them less fun.
                        2 p.m. — Have my meeting, then end up lying down for 90 minutes. When I get up, I'm hungry but
                        realize I haven't run the dishwasher, so I load it with the rest of the dirty dishes and set it
                        for a quick cycle, then grab some hummus and pita chips to tide me over. I really don't want to
                        keep working today (I've been going non-stop for about three weeks), but I need to at least chip
                        away at a little more work before I can take another break. I make some iced tea, add some more
                        pita chips and hummus to my Instacart basket so I don't forget, and get back to it.
                        5 p.m. — Alright, I think my brain has had enough. I'm pretty fried, so I head over to the couch
                        to watch YouTube with red wine and honey garlic boneless chicken wings ($24). I also see that a
                        shirt from an internet friend's merch collection is back in stock, so I order one ($41). Then I
                        time block my calendar for the next day and head to bed early. I'm planning to get up at 5 a.m.
                        tomorrow, so there's no use in staying up late. $65

                        Day Six
                        5:30 a.m. — Ahhhhh it's so early and my research proposal is due today. I turn on What A Day to
                        catch up on the news while my brain wakes up, then change into some workout clothes, drink some
                        pre-workout, and hop on the spin bike for a 30-minute Peloton class. I also post to my Instagram
                        story. I've amassed a decent following on all my other socials, but haven't quite figured out
                        the secret to Instagram growth, so I've been experimenting a bit over the past few weeks. Once
                        I'm done on the bike, I make an iced coffee, wash my face, get dressed, and head over to my
                        desk. I'd normally take a shower but I'm already behind schedule, so I cut my lunch break
                        shorter on my calendar to give myself a little time for a full-body wash.
                        7:30 a.m. — Finished labeling the data and am now moving it to our lab's computing cluster. My
                        stomach has been feeling off all morning, so I pop a couple Pepto Bismol tablets and wash it
                        down with some iced coffee.
                        8:30 a.m. — Stomach still not feeling great, likely because of how fast I ate those chicken
                        wings last night (or the wine, my stomach isn't historically a fan of either), so I make some
                        seltzer in my SodaStream (easily one of my best quarantine purchases, I drink about two liters
                        per day and used to buy ~24 1L plastic bottles per year, so I also feel better about reducing my
                        plastic consumption) and some ginger tea to see if that helps a bit. The early morning is also
                        starting to hit me a bit, so I take my meds and a 20-minute work break before my 9 a.m. meeting
                        to help my brain wake up a little more.
                        10 a.m. — One cup of ginger tea and a meeting later and I'm feeling a bit better! Also feeling a
                        bit hungry, so I make some toast and a vanilla protein shake.
                        5:30 p.m. — Home stretch! Pretty much all of the writing is done, I just need to finish making a
                        figure, and then I think I'm good. I order another thing of honey garlic boneless chicken wings
                        ($26) on UberEats as an incentive to finish writing between now and when it is delivered (~45
                        minutes), and plan to take a dinner break before reading over the final document, making any
                        needed revisions/edits, and sending it in! $26
                        8:30 p.m. — Finally finish it, do a final proofread, and submit! Then finish off my chicken
                        wings and a glass of wine, and head to bed around 9 — it's been a loooong day.

                        Day Seven
                        7 a.m. — Wake up after not sleeping very well and make some coffee. I was supposed to have a
                        dentist appointment at 9, but I get a text saying that my appointment has been canceled. I make
                        some toast and a protein shake for breakfast and take my meds.
                        10 a.m. — I'm still feeling pretty tired, but I make my way over to my desk and fill out my
                        planner with the things I'd like to get done today. I also check my email and see that a fiction
                        writing assignment that I thought was due today was actually due yesterday — whoops. It's for an
                        online class that I've actually really enjoyed, but I wish I'd signed up for it after my
                        qualifying exam because I'm swamped with work and don't have a ton of time for writing for fun.
                        I have a financial accountability group meeting at noon, so I plan to answer some emails,
                        prepare a meeting agenda for a student group meeting tonight, and finish the fiction writing
                        assignment.
                        3:30 p.m. — My financial accountability group meeting was really good. We had a spontaneous
                        discussion on the intersection of finances and values, which is something I struggle with a lot.
                        I also did some good work on my fiction writing assignment. I take a break and go for a walk,
                        then have a bit of a panic over whether to pause my gym membership — I love that style of
                        fitness but rarely actually go due to the location. I make a list of fitness activities that I
                        enjoy, then open up Google Maps and see what options I have near me. Having found a few, I email
                        my gym asking them to pause my membership through the end of June and reach out for some trial
                        classes. Then I grab a few protein bars before my next meeting and snack on them through the
                        evening.
                        7:30 p.m. — Done with meetings! I still have to make a YouTube video that needs to go up
                        tonight, so I wash my face and get my camera gear together to film, then do a quick edit on the
