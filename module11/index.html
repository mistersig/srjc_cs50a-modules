                Cranes are a family, the Gruidae, of large, long-legged, and long-necked birds in the group Gruiformes.
                The 15
                species of cranes are placed in three genera, Antigone, Balearica, and Grus. Unlike the similar-looking
                but
                unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks outstretched, not pulled back. Cranes live on all continents
                except
                Antarctica and South America.

                They are opportunistic feeders that change their diets according to the season and their own nutrient
                requirements. They eat a range of items from small rodents, eggs of birds, fish, amphibians, and insects
                to
                grain and berries.

                Cranes construct platform nests in shallow water, and typically lay two eggs at a time. Both parents
                help to
                rear the young, which remain with them until the next breeding season.

                Some species and populations of cranes migrate over long distances; others do not migrate at all. Cranes
                are
                solitary during the breeding season, occurring in pairs, but during the nonbreeding season, most species
                are
                gregarious, forming large flocks where their numbers are sufficient.



                Most species of cranes have been affected by human activities and are at the least classified as
                threatened,
                if
                not critically endangered. The plight of the whooping cranes of North America inspired some of the first
                US
                legislation to protect endangered species.

        <h2>In Mythology & Symbolism </h2>
        <article>
            The cranes' beauty and spectacular mating dances have made them highly symbolic birds in many cultures
            with
            records dating back to ancient times. Crane mythology is widely spread and can be found in areas such as
            India,
            the Aegean, South Arabia, China, Korea, Japan, and North America. In northern Hokkaidō, the women of the
            Ainu
            people performed a crane dance that was captured in 1908 in a photograph by Arnold Genthe. In Korea, a
            crane
            dance has been performed in the courtyard of the Tongdosa Temple since the Silla Dynasty (646 CE).
            <br>

            The Sanskrit epic poet Valmiki was inspired to write the first śloka couplet by the pathos of seeing a
            male
            sarus crane shot while dancing with its mate.
            <br>
            In Mecca, in pre-Islamic South Arabia, Allāt, Uzza, and Manāt were believed to be the three chief
            goddesses
            of
            Mecca, they were called the "three exalted cranes" (gharaniq, an obscure word on which 'crane' is the
            usual
            gloss). See The Satanic Verses for the best-known story regarding these three goddesses.

            In China, several styles of kung fu take inspiration from the movements of cranes in the wild, the most
            famous
            of these styles being Wing Chun, Hung Gar (tiger crane), and the Shaolin Five Animals style of fighting.
            Crane
            movements are well known for their fluidity and grace.
            <br>

            The Greek for crane is <em>Γερανος </em> <strong>(geranos)</strong>, which gives us the cranesbill, or
            hardy
            geranium. The crane was a bird
            of omen. In the tale of Ibycus and the cranes, a thief attacked Ibycus (a poet of the sixth century BCE)
            and
            left him for dead. Ibycus called to a flock of passing cranes, which followed the attacker to a theater
            and
            hovered over him until, stricken with guilt, he confessed to the crime.

            Pliny the Elder wrote that cranes would appoint one of their number to stand guard while they
            slept. The sentry would hold a stone in its claw, so that if it fell asleep, it would drop the stone and
            waken.
            A crane holding a stone in its claw is a well-known symbol in heraldry, and is known as a crane in its
            vigilance. Notably, however, the crest of Clan Cranstoun depicts a sleeping crane still in vigilance and
            holding
            the rock in its raised claw.

            Aristotle describes the migration of cranes in the History of Animals, adding an account of their fights
            with Pygmies as they wintered near the source of the Nile. He describes as untruthful an account that
            the
            crane
            carries a touchstone inside it that can be used to test for gold when vomited up. (This second story is
            not
            altogether implausible, as cranes might ingest appropriate gizzard stones in one locality and
            regurgitate
            them
            in a region where such stone is otherwise scarce.)

            Greek and Roman myths often portrayed the dance of cranes as a love of joy and a celebration of life,
            and
            the
            crane was often associated with both Apollo and Hephaestus.
            <br>
            In pre-modern Ottoman Empire, sultans would sometimes present a piece of crane feather [Turkish: turna
            teli]
            to
            soldiers of any group in the army<strong> (janissaries, sipahis etc.)</strong> who performed heroically
            during a
            battle. Soldiers
            would attach this feather to their caps or headgears which would give them some sort of a rank among
            their
            peers.
            <br>
            Throughout Asia, the crane is a symbol of happiness and eternal youth. In Japan, the crane is
            one of the mystical or holy creatures <strong>(others include the dragon and the tortoise)</strong> and
            symbolizes good fortune
            and longevity because of its fabled life span of a thousand years. The crane is one of the
            subjects in the tradition of origami, or paper folding. An ancient Japanese legend promises that anyone
            who
            folds a thousand origami cranes will be granted a wish by a crane. After World War II, the
            crane came to symbolize peace and the innocent victims of war through the story of schoolgirl Sadako
            Sasaki
            and
            her thousand origami cranes. Suffering from leukemia as a result of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and
            knowing
            she was dying, she undertook to make a thousand origami cranes before her death at the age of 12. After
            her
            death, she became internationally recognised as a symbol of the innocent victims of war and remains a
            heroine to
            many Japanese girls.
